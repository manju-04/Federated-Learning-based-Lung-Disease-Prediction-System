# 🧠 Federated Learning-based Lung Disease Prediction using Heterogeneous Data

A major project developed using **Federated Learning** with CNN, SVM, and Random Forest to predict lung diseases such as **COVID-19 and Pneumonia** from Chest X-ray and CT-Scan images using **heterogeneous datasets**.

## 📌 Abstract

This project demonstrates how Federated Learning (FL) can be used to train AI models securely and privately across distributed medical image datasets. FL ensures that sensitive patient data remains on local servers while sharing only model updates.

We implemented three combinations:
- PCA + CNN
- PCA + CNN + SVM
- PCA + CNN + Random Forest

Best result achieved: **98.33% accuracy with PCA + CNN + SVM**
